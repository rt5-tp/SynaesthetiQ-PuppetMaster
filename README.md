SynaesthetiQ adds another dimension to your experience of music. SynaesthetiQ connects to your home sound system and analyses songs in real-time to create mesmerising and tantalising visualisations. The colour and brightness of lights will be influenced by the full spectrum of sound.

You can use SynaesthetiQ for:

- Brightening up a house party
- Relaxed Home listening
- Visualise music for those with auditory impairments.
